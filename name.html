			<h3>Free Tour concept</h3><br>
			<p>The Free Tour concept has been around for quite a while but is a relatively new way to discover cities compared to the traditional tour concept, which of course has a much longer legacy. Many of today's younger travellers will likely be aware of, if not familiar with, free walking tours as they have become increasingly popular and ever-present in key destinations, and indeed beyond in recent years.</p>
			<h3>A Misconception about Free Tours</h3><br>
			<p>The word FREE has obvious appeal to budget-conscious travellers but it is also a word that can ring alarm bells; especially in relation to something that traditionally carries with it a relatively substantial cost and makes up a significant part of a particular industry, such as guided tours. But free doesn't mean worthless when it comes to free tours. Quite the contrary. It is by no means the reserve of a strapped backpacker or miserly tourist. It's a concept which actually can be obliged to deliver more than the traditional paid tour and something which can be truly valuable, worthwhile, and rewarding to all types of travellers.</p>
			<h3>How does it work?</h3><br>
			<p>One question we are asked regularly is how can the tours be free?. The tours are free, because unlike regular tour providers' services, there is no set price for taking a tour, no prescribed fee to pay regardless of the tour experience itself. Instead, you are free to 'tip' your guide as you see fit after your tour.
				This is perhaps a strange idea to get used to initially, but there are a number of reasons why this style of touring has taken off as a valid, popular way of discovering cities. As the tour guides don't receive any other income for giving these tours (from any organizations or local bodies), this means they must really earn their tips. As their income will tend to fluctuate from tour to tour, the guides motivation to deliver a top-quality tour is ever-present, meaning far less room for complacency on their part than if they were being paid a set amount for a guided tour. The tour itself must be great for the concept to work.</p>
			<h3>Tipping: something to consider when taking a Free Tour</h3><br>
			<p>Furthermore, tipping your guide at the end of the tour means the power is yours. Although not obligatory, you decide what the tour was worth or what you can afford, if anything. The value-for-money ratio is determined by you so there is no risk of being 'ripped-off' or feeling like you didn't get your money's worth.
				Tip for tips: If you do decide to tip, make sure to bring your maximum tip budget in smaller denominations. This way you can give your guide the perfect amount they deserve as determined by yourself (after the tour of course) without the hassle of having too little if you think they deserved more or offering a large bill only to ask for change back. </p>

			<h3> Why to visit Klaipeda today?</h3><br>
			<p> Klaipeda is a very speacial place, combining old German style architecture with the modern art-house buildings. It is a pearl of a Baltic sea, which annually attracts thousand of tourists from all over the world! These days, KlaipÄ—da is now the home of a bilingual German-Lithuanian institution, the Hermann-Sudermann-Schule, as well as an English-language University, LCC International University. </p>
